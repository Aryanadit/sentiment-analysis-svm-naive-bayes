# Sentiment Analysis Using SVM and Naïve Bayes

This project implements sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using two machine learning models:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naïve Bayes**

The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
