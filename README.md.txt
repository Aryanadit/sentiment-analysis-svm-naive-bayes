# Sentiment Analysis Using SVM and NaÃ¯ve Bayes

This project implements sentiment analysis on movie reviews using two machine learning models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes

The goal is to classify IMDb reviews as positive or negative.

âœ… Linear SVM  
âœ… NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier  
âœ… Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, Porter stemming

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **SVM** accuracy (Drama): 87.5%
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** accuracy (Drama): 80%

SVM generally performed better across genres.
